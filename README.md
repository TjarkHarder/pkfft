# README

A simple C program to decompose the (linear) matter power spectrum in discrete Fourier modes.


## Requirements

Currently, the code relies on

- GNU Scientific Library (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for 1d (spline) interpolation
- FFTW (https://fftw.org/) for Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)


## TODO

In the future, this repository will host a C library for the FFT-based calculation of the (one-loop) galaxy power spectrum in redshift space.
